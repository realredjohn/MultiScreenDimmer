# MultiScreenDimmer

Copyright (c) 2024 **Mehmet Melih Solt**

## Description

**MultiScreenDimmer** is a handy tool designed to simplify adjusting the brightness of multi-monitor setups. Created out of a personal need for easier brightness control across multiple screens, this tool allows users to dim specific monitors quickly with just a click or a customizable shortcut. This app achieves its dimming effect by creating a black screen overlay on top of everything, allowing users to achieve a darker display than default brightness settings.

You can save **profiles** to tailor dimming settings for different scenarios, whether you're watching content on your main monitor, gaming, or simply want to focus on a particular screen. With MultiScreenDimmer, managing the brightness of your multi-monitor setup becomes a convenient and effortless task.
